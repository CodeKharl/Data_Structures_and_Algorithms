# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repository contains my personal collection of **Data Structures and Algorithm** implementations using the Python programming language.  
Each file focuses on a specific concept or problem-solving approach, with clear and structured code for better understanding.

## ðŸ“š Purpose
The main goal of this repository is **learning and practice**.  
You can use these implementations to:
- Understand fundamental data structures.
- Learn different algorithm techniques.
- Use them as reference for solving programming problems.

## ðŸ›  Contents
The repository includes:
- **Linked Lists** (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- **Stacks & Queues**
- **Trees & Graphs**
- **Sorting & Searching Algorithms**
- **Recursion Examples**
- **Other Data Structure Implementations**
